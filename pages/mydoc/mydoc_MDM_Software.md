In order to install the application for the first time, is necessary to download the 'First installation package'.<br>
For upgrading (by overwriting) an already existing installation is possible to use the 'Installation upgrade' package, that doesn't include the configuration files: in this case, please make a backup of the already installed version's files and of the related databases and read carefully the 'Readme' file. For the purpose of the Meta&Data manager's version upgrade, the 'Utility files' package contains the scripts and utilities for upgrading the version of the databases (in orer to use them correctly, please the Readme file).<br>
Is furthermore possible to replace the Eurostat's NSI_WS snd MA_WS services available in the install packages with the most recent versions, included in the '.NET 6.0 Services' package: in this case is required the installation of .NET Core 6.0 "
